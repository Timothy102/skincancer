# Skin cancer Binary Classifier via Kaggle 

Skin cancer is classified by two main types: melanoma and non-melanoma. Currently, 2-3 million non-melanoma and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers are diagnosed globally each year. The incidence of skin cancer is evident by a statistic based on the World Health Organization (WHO) that states that every 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer. The increased incidence of skin cancer is attributed to the depleted ozone level and as the atmophosphere loses its protective filter function, an increased amount of solar UV radiation will reach the Earth's surface. Additionally, increased reactreation exposure to the sun and history of sunburn are main factors that predispose an individual to the development of skin cancer. These factors are preventable and each individual is responsible to protect themselves from the sun (i.e., using sunblock).
